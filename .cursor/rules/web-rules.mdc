 Main Objective:

Enable Cursor AI to autonomously identify, debug, and resolve bugs or issues within the CRM application built with React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS, React Router DOM, and Supabase.

üö© Issue Identification

1. Console and Logs:

Immediately check browser console errors and warnings.

Identify clearly stated error messages or stack traces.

2. Network Requests:

Verify failed or delayed API calls, especially interactions with Supabase.

Inspect HTTP response codes, headers, and payloads.

üîç Debugging Frontend

React Components:

Validate component rendering issues (state/props mismatches, loading states, and conditional rendering).

Resolve TypeScript type errors immediately.

Routing Issues (React Router DOM):

Confirm correct route definitions.

Ensure hooks (useNavigate, useParams, useLocation) are used correctly and effectively.

Styling Issues (Tailwind CSS):

Check Tailwind configuration (tailwind.config.js) paths.

Validate classes and ensure CSS is correctly generated and applied.

‚öôÔ∏è Backend Integration (Supabase)

Authentication and Authorization:

Diagnose issues related to user sessions and permissions.

Ensure proper Supabase auth method usage.

Database CRUD Operations:

Verify Row-Level Security (RLS) rules and table permissions.

Check correct implementation of Supabase client methods.

Real-Time Subscriptions:

Confirm channels subscribe/unsubscribe logic.

Validate real-time data integration with React state.

üì¶ Build Configuration (Vite & TypeScript)

Ensure the vite.config.ts file is correctly set up:

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
});

Confirm TypeScript configurations (tsconfig.json) are error-free and aligned with project requirements.

‚úÖ Error Handling Best Practices

Implement consistent error handling with try-catch blocks.

Include descriptive error logs to quickly pinpoint issues.

By following these guidelines, Cursor AI can systematically identify, debug, and autonomously resolve issues to maintain and enhance the app‚Äôs functionality.
